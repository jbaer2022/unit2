Account/List Searcher and Pagination
By : Jacob Baer

The intention of this project was to take a large list of accounts and then convert it into a multipage website
that can can switch pages by the click of a button. Each page displays at most 10 accounts at a time. Along with this the project also had a search bar that immediately took the search value as an input and it searched the list and narrowed the pages down to accounts that matched the search.
